test()

tests for the validity of the sudoku
The test function can be used as a stand alone with an array named sud[9][9]

Explanation
The code checks if a number 0 to 9 is repeated in either a row or a column , if this happens then the suduko is invalid else it is valid

NOTE :

Improvements in code saved as question_3_2.cpp

Increased code efficiency.
The row check takes place while input is being taken.
Removed a couple of for loops (less number of iterations taking place now).

HAVE FUN!
